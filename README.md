## 🚀 Flagship Systems

### 1. 🔍 ATS Scoring & Parsing Engine
The ATS Engine simulates high-tier enterprise parsing logic (e.g., Greenhouse, Workday) to evaluate resumes against target roles.
*   **Mathematical Scoring Rubric**: Scores are derived deterministically using a weighted index:
    $$\text{ATS Score} = \text{round}\left( (\text{Format} \times 0.25) + (\text{Content Metrics} \times 0.35) + (\text{Keyword Density} \times 0.40) \right)$$
*   **Structural Section Check**: Ensures the presence of mandatory resume blocks: Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
*   **Keyword Match**: Compares the resume content with target job descriptions using a text-normalization pipeline.
*   **Tactical Feedback**: Generates granular recommendations, providing concrete "before" and "after" examples to help rewrite vague bullets into metric-driven achievements.

### 2. 🧬 Deep Evaluation (Deep Eval) Engine
For candidate validation, the Deep Eval service goes beyond static resume text, incorporating public developer history:
*   **GitHub Username Extractor & Heuristics**: Automatically searches the uploaded resume text using RegExp patterns matching `github.com/[username]` or `github: @[username]`, ignoring system-level false positives (e.g., `settings`, `explore`, `pricing`).
*   **Parallel Fetching & Integration**: Pulls the public profile (name, bio, followers, created date) and top 30 owner repositories in parallel with an 8-second maximum execution timeout, utilizing a `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback for higher rate limits.
*   **Open Source vs. Self Projects**: Implements strict classification rules. General repository owners are graded as *Self Projects* unless there is evidence of community engagement (stars/forks/contributors). True open-source contributions involve external repository edits.
*   **Dynamic Bonuses & Deductions**:
    *   **Bonuses**: Earn +5 for GSoC, +3 for GSSoC, +3 to +5 for founder/co-founder roles, +2 for portfolio sites, and +1 for LinkedIn links.
    *   **Deductions**: Deducts points for simple classroom tutorials (todo-lists, calculators), missing links, broken URLs, or unverified claims.
*   **Missing Keywords**: Isolates up to 10 critical technical skills missing from the candidate's resume relative to the job requirements.

### 3. 💼 Career Ops CRM Tracker & Pipelines
A fully-fledged Customer Relationship Management (CRM) board to track, optimize, and organize the application pipeline:
*   **Canonical Application Statuses**: Tracks roles via discrete steps: `evaluated`, `applied`, `responded`, `interview`, `offer`, `rejected`, `discarded`, and `skip`.
*   **Salary Benchmarking Engine & Experience Scaling**: Integrates local dataset lookups (`data/salaries.india.json`) that adjust salary bands automatically based on the candidate's experience years:
    *   *Fresher/Intern (0-1 yrs)*: Bottom of range.
    *   *Junior (2-3 yrs)*: Lower-mid range.
    *   *Mid-level (4-6 yrs)*: Direct median dataset value.
    *   *Senior (7-10 yrs)*: Upper range.
    *   *Staff/Principal (11+ yrs)*: Top of range + 25% premium.
    *   *AI Fallback*: If the target role is missing from the database, the AI orchestrator dynamically generates a calibrated market estimate.
*   **Dynamic Cadence Offset**: Automatically calculates the next date a user should follow up based on application status and cumulative touchpoints:
    *   *Base Intervals*: `evaluated` (3 days), `applied` (5 days), `responded` (4 days), `interview` (2 days).
    *   *Follow-up Offsets*: 0 followups (+0 days), 1 followup (+1 day), 2 followups (+2 days), $\ge 3$ followups (+4 days).
*   **AI Dimensions**: Classifies applications under **Role Archetypes** (e.g., `backend`, `data_ml`, `devops`, `frontend`) and identifies **Primary Blockers** (e.g., `stack-mismatch`, `seniority-mismatch`, `domain-mismatch`).
*   **Diagnostic CLI Tools**:
    ```bash
    # Run sanity checks on database constraints and status mapping
    npm run verify:career-ops
    
    # Run developer repairs on inconsistent tracker entries
    npm run doctor:career-ops
    ```

## 🤖 Background Automation Pipelines (Cron Services)

MockMate features automated cron handlers to maintain data liveness and pipeline freshness:

### 1. Opportunity API Crawler (`GET /api/cron/scan`)
*   Periodically scans configured companies (e.g., Cohere, Anthropic via Lever/Greenhouse APIs) in concurrency-throttled chunks.
*   Applies a double-keyword filter: positive keywords (e.g., `engineer`, `developer`, `machine learning`) to match roles, and negative keywords (e.g., `intern`, `junior`) to filter out irrelevant posts.
*   Deduplicates results against existing database entries using URL and cryptographic job fingerprint matches.

### 2. Playwright Liveness Checker (`GET /api/cron/liveness`)
*   Launches headless Chromium instances in the background using Playwright to navigate to saved job posting URLs.
*   Validates whether opportunities are still open by crawling the DOM, checking text components, and analyzing interactive elements (e.g., presence of "Apply Now", "Apply for this Job" buttons).
*   Updates statuses in the database to `active`, `uncertain`, or `expired` to prevent users from applying to dead listings.

### 3. Cadence Recalculator (`GET /api/cron/cadence`)
*   Identifies active users who have tracked applications.
*   Recalculates follow-up cadence targets based on status changes and new follow-up logs, ensuring the dashboard notifications and active reminders stay correct.

## 🛠️ Extended Features

*   **Resume Tailoring**: Adapts summaries, lists relevant technologies, and re-orders work highlights to match target job descriptions without fabricating credentials.
*   **AI Cover Letters & Cold Outreach**: Automatically creates professional cover letters and short LinkedIn cold outreach notes customized to recruiter preferences.
*   **Project Mode (DevCube Sandbox)**: Multi-file browser IDE powered by `@codesandbox/sandpack-react` and `@monaco-editor/react`. Allows junior developers to solve challenges, modify starter codes, and receive code-quality ratings.
*   **System Design Canvas**: A visual diagramming editor supporting drag-and-drop components (API Gateways, Load Balancers, Databases, Caches) to map distributed system layouts.
*   **Certification Hub**: Practice environments for AWS, Azure, MongoDB, Salesforce, and PCAP Python exams, offering step-by-step rationale.
*   **Daily Coding Arena**: Multi-language workspace executing code in Python, JavaScript, Go, and C++ against custom test suites.
